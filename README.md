## Hardware Interfaces for VR Applications: Evaluation on Prototypes
This paper goes into detail about the various types of hardware that have been used for VR and how the user would interact when playing interactive games. The paper talks of Microsoft's Kinect Sensor. A camera that was released for use with the Xbox 360 onwards, the hardware allows the user to control the consoles interface via gestures and also give oral instructions via the built in mircophone. The paper also makes note of Nintendo's Wiimote for the Nintendo Wii. The Wiimote makes use of acceleromters to track hand movement and also a classic single hand-held joystick controller known as the Nunchuck. The final controller the paper makes reference to is Razer's Hydra controller. "It consists of a base, and two controllers connected to it with a wire. The controllers are interchangeable and look exactly the same."[1] The Hydra controller supports such hardware as the Oculus Rift, a VR headset that was kickstarted in 2012 with the interest of developers primarily working within the games industry.

## Exploitation of Heuristics for Virtual Environments
This paper analyses 50 papers in total to do with heuristics for VR. They claim that out of a staggering 50 papers only 10 papers had made use of or made reference to SG2004. The paper begins with the twelve heuristics that were proposed during the year 2004 by Sutcliffe and Gault. It was based from Nielson's heuristics and also Sutcliffe's and Kaur's work from the year 2000. The twelve heuristics are as follows: 

* Natural engagement
* Compatibility wit the user's tasks and domain
* Natural expression of action
* Close coordination of action and representation
* Realistic feedback
* Faithful viewpoints
* Navigation and orientation support
* Clear entry and exit points
* Consistent departures
* Support for learning
* Clear turn-taking
* Sense of presence

These heuristics appear to be clear and precise of how VR should be developed however the author believes that many developers are in fact ignoring them. The author also believes that " the heuristics are being cited increasingly, but they have only been used, either fully or partly by 10 out of 50 citations"[2]

## Investigating the Balance between Virtuality and Reality in Mobile Mixed Reality UI Design - User Perception of an Augmented City
This paper was about a mobile application that makes use of augmented reality to inform the user of informtion about the city via information points which show up once the user has aimed their mobile phone at a specific place. The prototype user interfaces were identical except one was a 3D model of the city whereas the other was a 'live view'. During their prototyping stages the developers of the application had taken to the streets to test their application on random members of the public. In total they had 35 participants that were aged between 16-63 with an average age of 31, all participants had a mobile phone but only 63 percent had a mobile phone that had a touch screen feature. Each participant used an LG Optimus 3D P920 and took around 30 minutes to complete the survey/test. The participants had to make use of the 3D model view and also the 'live' view, except the 'live' view was infact a pre-recorded video of the city which the developers prompted the participants to follow the video imitating that they were infact using a live view from the mobile phones camera. After the 30 minute test of the prototype the developers asked for feedback on the early stages of the application, the common response was from the 'live' view mode, one participant had said, "Allow users to select between a camera based and virtual reality based user interface according to the situation"[3] This was due to the social implications the application could be made apparent to the user when the applicaiton is in use. The user may be using the live view option and other members of the public may think that the user is videoing/taking images of them without their consent. Although this application seems to be a strong and well-thought-out concept, it needs to be improved somewhat. 

## Homuncular Flexibility in Virtual Reality
This paper was about a series of experiments to do with how the human brain will easily believe illusions within a short amount of time. "For example, in “rubber hand illusion” studies (Botvinick & Cohen, 1997), participants saw
a rubber hand on the table in front of them and observed it being stroked by a soft brush while feeling synchronous
touch on their real hand hidden under the table. Participants gained a sense of ownership of the
hand, such that they flinched when it was threatened."[4] The author/s of this paper believe that if they were to give participants a different avatar or body within virtual reality then the participants will begin to belive that they are that specific avatar. The participants will adapt to use whatever means they deem possible to be as effective as they possibly can when given a task. 

## (Re-)Examination of Multimodal Augmented Reality
This paper was about introduce different ways of thinking about augmented reality. "In particular, the notion of real and virtual were respeciﬁed in terms of stimuli to emphasize physicality and perception, and a new form was introduced, namely mediated stimuli."[5] This paper was rather interesting and definitely made myself think about what definition I reference to when talking about AR. I need to read further into this topic. 

## Brain Measurement for Usability Testing and Adaptive Interfaces: An Example of Uncovering Syntactic Workload with Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy
This paper was about user interfaces and how the brain reacts to them. The author "presented a novel experiment protocol and a set of analysis algorithms that can help UI evaluators, or designers of adaptive systems, to gain information about the workload experienced by users in the various cognitive resources in their brains while they work with computer systems"[6] I found this paper quite interesting but also think that it was possibly over the top however I also think this is due to the complexity of each experiment they had undergone. This is also another topic I need to read further into.
